                        Cryptocurrency and blockchain have existed for a long time,
                        but there has never been a decentralized space for artists to
                        experiment. In the art world, cryptocurrencies including NFTs
                        are vehicles for artists to fulfill their needs and dreams in
                        a better way. It is not only about buying low and selling
                        high. We aim to build a space to support the ideology of
                        artists and maintain the integrity of arts, while involving
                        some elements of crypto. In Gallery Finance, you can open a
                        workshop to let the community design and produce NFTs
                        together based on voting, run your own auction for your arts
                        and, store and exhibit your arts forever through
                        decentralized storage.
